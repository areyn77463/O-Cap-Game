# O-Cap-Game
This is a simple turn-based object capture game. You are met with a menu where you can choose options that affect both the player and the enemies. There are options for random/set starting places, autonomous/human player, and moving/stationary enemies.

To play, choose how you want the game options to be set in the main menu and use 1 to launch the game. Pressing enter after entering a, w, s, or d will move your character. The object is to capture all of the pieces in the shortest amount of moves.

During this project I learned how to split a larger program into headers and source files; build a grid out of arrays; use nested statements for rules on the grid and for player/pieces; make a dynamic menu that changes depending on the options chosen; record a leaderboard;
